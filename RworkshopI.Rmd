# Preface
## What Are Covered in this Series Workshop
* **A overview of R**
* **Data manipulation (input/output, row/column selections, etc.)**
* Descriptive and binary hypotheses (summary, correlation, t-test, etc.)
* Multiple regression (OLS, GLS, MLM, etc.)
* Presentation (table, graph)




# An Overview of R
## What's R?
* R is a programming language

* R is developed and maintained by statisticians.

* R is a <span style="color:purple">weird</span> programming language
    + Weird for users of typical statistical software (such as STATA, SPSS, and Excel)
        + object-oriented programming (OOP).
    + Weird for programmers: inconsistent and strict coding
        + The debate of assignment operator (`=` vs. `<-`)
        + `library("interplot")` == `library(interplot)`
* So, why do we still learn weirdo?


## Why R? {.columns-2 .build}
<img src="http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b01a3fc45e6fc970b-pi" height="400" width="450"/>
[Magoulas & King, 2014, *Data Science Salary Survey*.](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/stratasurvey.csp)



* It's free!! 
* It's developing!
    + R is very compatible with new techniques
    + e.g., Network analysis, spatial analysis with GIS, and text analysis with big data. 
* It's multi-lingual!
```{r eval = F}
"Hello 你好 안녕하세요 здравствуйте"
```
* It's popular!







## What can R do?

* Do statistics as STATA, SAS, SPSS, EXCEL,...
* Scrape data from websites as Python, Java,...
* Create presentation slides, documents, webpages as MS Word, Powerpoint, TexMaker, Dreamweaver,...
* Solve math problems as Matlab, Mathematica, ...
* An observation in the "useR" conference (2015):
    
    " I saw how R and Hadoop is used to make the <span style="color:purple">Tribal Wars game</span> engaging for 150M players; R is used to <span style="color:purple">teach high schoolers</span> to code, as their first programming language; R is used to help <span style="color:purple">veterinarians</span> identify lameness in horses using 3-d accelerometers ..."

## Software and package installations {.columns-2}
### Software installation
[![R](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)](https://www.r-project.org/)

[![Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blue-250.png)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

<span style="color:green">Tip</span>:
<div class="notes">
Install R before Rstudio; so does in updating.
Using the [Rstudio preview](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
</div>


### Package installation and loading
Packages are "<span style="color:purple">Apps</span>" for your R system. You can use R without them, but if you want fun, install them ~

`install.packages(<package name>)`
`install_github("<repositary/package name>")`

[An example](https://github.com/sammo3182/interplot)

Click the apps: Load the package

`library(<package name>)`
`require(<package name>)`

## RStudio{.flexbox .vcenter}
<img src="image/rstudio.png" height="500" width = "900" />


## Wrap Up
* R is a programming language that can do a lot of statistical and non-statistical things.

* Install R, RStudio (optional), and packages (optional)

* Next: Let's Start the Journey
    + <div class="centered">![journey](http://i.imgur.com/PbLQzSi.gif)</div>

# Do Statistics with R
## Set where to locate the data and store the results
* Always check or set the <span style="color:purple">working directory</span> first
    + `getwd()`
    + `setwd("E:/R workshop/rworkshop")`
* Or click, click, click, and click in Rstudio
    + <img src=image/setwd.png />
 

## Vector {.smaller}
(<span style="color:green">Tip</span>)
```{r}
1:10  # numeric (integer/double)
c("R", "workshop") # character
3 == 5  # boolean
factor(1:3, levels = 1:3, labels = c("low", "medium", "high"))  # factor 
```

<div class="notes">
The `factor` is a R *function*. Ususally, the first component ("`1:3`") of a R function is the  <span style="color:purple">object</span>, the target this function is going to work on. The rest components ("`levels = 1:3, labels = c("low", "medium", "high")`") are <span style="color:purple">arguments</span>, with which setting the special conditions the object is dealt.

If you are not sure about the utility of certain arguments, ask R for help by `?`, e.g.,
```{r eval=FALSE}
?factor
```

</div>


## Dataset {.smaller}
```{r}
matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)  # matrix
data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)  # data.frame
list(c("one", "two"), c(3, 4)) # 2-D list
```

----
```{r}
array(c(1:4,5:8), dim = c(2, 2, 3)) # 3-D or n-D "list""
```


## Save data to an object
```{r}
x <- rep(c(.01, .05, .1), times = 2) # repeat 1:5 for twice
df <- data.frame(x = 1:1, y = 3:4)
list <- list(x, df)

list # == print(list)
```

----

Basic rules for object name:

* Don't start with numbers (WRONG: `1stday`)
* No special signs except for `.` and `-` (WRONG: `M&M`)
* Case sensitivity (`X != x`)


## Attributes of an object {.smaller .build}
* Structure
```{r}
str(df)
```
* Unique values (<span style="color:green">Tip</span>)
```{r}
unique(df$x)
```
<div class="notes">
What is the `$`?  It is used to call specific columns a data.frame. 

To call the components in a vector, we use "[]"
```{r}
x[3]
```

To call the components in a list, we use "[[]]"
```{r}
list[[2]]
```

</div>

* Names
```{r}
names(df)
```

----

Length
```{r}
length(x)
```

Class
```{r}
class(x);typeof(x)  # ; is used to write two commands in one line
```

## Detect the attributes
Using `is.`
```{r}
is.numeric(x)
is.na(x) # detect if x includes missing values
```


## Do math in R
```{r eval=FALSE}
# basic math
x + (1 - 2) * 3 / 4

# advanced math
x^2;sqrt(x);log(x);exp(x)

# matrix algebra
z <- matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)
z + z - z
z %*% z  # inner mul<span style="color:green">Tip</span>lication 
z %o% z  # outter mul<span style="color:green">Tip</span>lication

# logical evaluation
x == z; x != Z
x & z; x | z
x > z; x <= z
```

## Wrap up
* Set the working directory first: `setwd()`
* Four types of data: numeric, character, logical, factor
* Four types of datasets: matrix, data.frame, list, array
* Save the things into an object by `<-`, e.g., `list <- list(x, df)`
    + Objects have attributes (`str()`, `length()`, `names()`, etc.)
    + Detect the attributes with `is.`, e.g., `is.numeric(x)`
* Do math in R

----

Next: let's have a look at the data, first.

<div class="centered">
<img src=https://powerofus.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka080000000D4YB&feoid=00N800000059i9I&refid=0EM800000000Tnw />
</div>

Or click the "table" sign in the "Envirnoment" tab in RStudio 

# Data Analysis
## Input data {.build}
* R can read almost all types of datasets.
```{r eval=FALSE}
load("<FileName>.RData")

df_txt <- read.table("<FileName>.txt")
df_csv <- read.csv("<FileName>.csv")

```
* Some data are already embedded in R. To call them, use `data()`, e.g.
```{r eval=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
```


## Input data with packages{.smaller}
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Excel sheets
library(readxl)
df_excel <- read_excel("<FileName>.xls");read_excel("<FileName>.xlsx") 

# SPSS/STATA/SAS
library(foreign)
df_spss <- read.spss("<FileName>.sav")
df_stata <- read.dta("<FileName>.dta") 
df_sas <- read.sas7bdat("<FileName>.sas7bdat")  

# JavaScript Object Notation 
library(rjson)
df_json <- fromJSON(file = "<FileName>.json" )

# XML/Html
df_xml <- xmlTreeParse("<url>")
df_html <- readHTMLTable(url, which=3)

```
More instructions are available in this [blog](http://blog.datacamp.com/r-data-import-tutorial/).


## Output data {.build}
* Save in a R dataset (`.RData`) <span style="color:green">Tip</span>
```{r eval = F}
save(object, file = "./Data/mydata.Rdata")
```
<div class="notes">
In R, the directory are written with `/`.
</div>

* Save as `.csv`
```{r eval = F}
write.csv(object, file = "mydata.csv")
```


## Manipulate the data{.build}
* let's call a dataset first,
```{r}
data(mtcars)
```
* How many variables and what are they?
```{r}
ncol(mtcars);names(mtcars)
```

## Have a look at the data{.build}

```{r}
head(mtcars) # show the first six lines of mtcars

```

## Look at a specific area in a dataset

In a dataset or matrix, a special row and column can be specified by `data[row#, col#]` or `data["rowName","colName"]`. 

So, for example, to select the first two rows of the third and fourth columns:
```{r}
mtcars[1:2,3:4] # show first and the second rows of the third and fourth columns
```

## Row/column selection{.small .build}

* Select an entire row or column (<span style="color:green">Tip</span>:  The <span style="color:red">comma</span>!)
```{r eval=FALSE}
mtcars[,"mpg"] # show the column "mpg"
```

* Select components of a selected row or column
```{r}
mtcars[,"mpg"][3]  # show the third component of the column "mpg"
```

----

Select with special conditions
```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$mpg < 20,][1,] # show the first rows which mpg are below 5.
```

Create new rows/columns
```{r}
mtcars$id <- seq(1:nrow(mtcars))
names(mtcars)
```
