# Preface

## What's R?
"R is a programming language and software environment...blah, blah, blah..."

</div>

* So, what is it (in plain English)?
    + A *programming language* maintained by statisticians
    + An alternative to a bunch of softwares


## Why do you want to use R? {.columns-2}
* It's popular!
* It's developing!
* It's free!!

Tip:
<div class="notes">
* It's multi-lingual!
```{r}

```
</div>

## What can you do with R?

* Do statistics as STATA, SAS, SPSS, EXCEL,...
* Scrap data from websites as Python, Java,...
* Create presentation slides, documents, webpages as MS Word, Powerpoint, TexMaker, Dreamweaver,...
* Solve math problems as Matlab, Mathematica, ...
* An observation in the "useR" conference (2015):
    
    " I saw how R and Hadoop is used to make the <span style="color:red">Tribal Wars game</span> engaging for 150M players; R is used to <span style="color:red">teach high schoolers</span> to code, as their first programming language; R is used to help <span style="color:red">veterinarians</span> identify lameness in horses using 3-d accelerometers ..."

## Software and Package Installations {.columns-2}
### Software installation
[![R](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)](https://www.r-project.org/)

[![Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blue-250.png)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

Tips:
<div class="notes">
- Install R before Rstudio; so does in updating.
- Using the [Rstudio preview](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
</div>


### Package installation and loading

Type the following codes in the console of R/Rstudio:

`install.packages(package name)`
`install_github("repositary/package name")`

[An example](https://github.com/sammo3182/interplot)

Load the package
`library(package name)`
`require(package name)`


## Wrap Up
* R can do a lot of statistical and non-statistical things.
* R is free, so free to try.
* Installation includes three steps: 
    + install R; 
    + install Rstudio (optional); 
    + install packages (optional). 

# Start the Journey
## Set the working directory
* Always check or set the working directory first
    + `getwd()`
    + `setwd("E:/R workshop/rworkshop")`

   
## Create a vector/variable/item/stuff
```{r}
1:10  # numeric
c("R", "workshop") # character
3 == 5  # logical
factor(1:3, levels = 1:3, labels = c("low", "medium", "high"))  # factor
```

## Create a set of data
```{r}
matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)  # matrix
data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)  # data.frame
```

## Two special data sets
```{r}
list(c("one", "two"), c(3, 4))
```
----
```{r}
array(c(1:4,5:8), dim = c(2, 2, 3))
```


## Save them for later
```{r eval = F}
x <- 1:10
x_matrix <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)
x.list <- list(x, x_matrix)
```
